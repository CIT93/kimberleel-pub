## Evaluate your food choices.

- The types of food that you eat can also have an effect on your carbon footprint. You will have a higher carbon footprint if you eat meat from domesticated animals regularly, and you will have a lower carbon footprint if you eat no meat or animal products at all.[3]
    - If you eat domestic meat on a daily basis, then add 10 points.
    - If you eat domestic meat a few times per week, then add 8 points.
    - If you are a vegetarian, then add 4 points.
    - If you are a vegan or only eat wild meat, then add 2 points.
    - You would also add 12 points if most of the food you eat is prepackaged convenience food, such as frozen pizza, cereal, and potato chips. - If you have a good balance of fresh and convenience food, then just add 6 points. If you only eat fresh, locally grown, or hunted food, then add 2 points.
